# About the project

This is a system for generating Minecraft worlds based on georeferenced
images to recreate real territories. Our personal goal is using it for
creating Minetest worlds but as it uses pymclevel it is supposed to work
fine with Minecraft.


# Software requirements


Requires:

	- pymclevel, https://github.com/olea/pymclevel
	- python-gdal, http://www.gdal.org


Optionally you would like to use geo tools like:

	- the gdal CLI tools, http://www.gdal.org
	- qgis
